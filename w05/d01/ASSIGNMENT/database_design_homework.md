# Practice Database Design

## Introduction

To practice modeling databases, you'll be tasked with drawing ERDs for a handful of hypothetical applications. Think about what models you would need and what tables you'd create, including the associated attributes and how they would related to other tables.

Remember to consider all different angles in each of these examples. What jobs relationships exist? What people are there? What objects and intangible ideas are necessary? How would you organize it?

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Pick one of the following in your group, design the table relationships, and draw them:

  - an app to run a grocery store
  - an app to run an airline
  - an app to run a school
  - an app to run a team of developers

#### Deliverable

An ERD diagram, using crows foot notation, of whatever app you choose.  For example:

</p>

> Note: this example has "Items" as placeholders for the attributes.
