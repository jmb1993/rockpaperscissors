### Trillo Cashed

* As a user, I want cards in the done column to disappear when I click them, so I can keep my done column compact.
* As a user, I want cards in the to do column to move to the done column when I click them, so I can keep track of my progress
* As a user, I want to a new card to be added to the todo column when I enter text and click the 'Add Card' button, so I can add new things to my list
