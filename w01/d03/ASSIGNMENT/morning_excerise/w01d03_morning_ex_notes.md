## INTRO (5 minutes)

`screen music`

**Navigate to the WDI_BACON folder on your personal computer**

From this location, `git pull upstream master`

In the week 1, day 3 folder, navigate to the `morning_exercise` directory. You should see a markdown and two starter HTML files.

It sure was hot in the room yesterday wasn't it?!

**What:**
We will get practice using JavaScript fundamentals using different datatypes and conditional statements.<br>
**Why:**
As a developer it's important to understand how the building blocks, or primitive datatypes work. It's also important to begin thinking like a developer by adding logic to a program using control flow structures such as conditional statements.<br>
**How:** We will create a program to replicate an air conditioner. We will create a second program that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. <br>

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES (SWBAT)
1. Write two programs that use conditional statements.
2. Explain what `parseInt` does.
3. Practice working with JavaScript fundamental datatypes (numbers and strings), arithmetic operators and logical operators.

## I DO—Demo (5 minutes)
- show how to open an html file from the CLI.
- demo how the air conditioner should work
- `parseInt` Keep in mind that `prompt` always returns a string. But we want to compare numbers. Talk about `parseInst` or suggest it.

## YOU DO—Conditional Air Conditioner (15 minutes)
- Check in after 10 minutes

## WE DO—Solve Conditional Air Conditioner (5 minutes)
– Show solution or code it live
- Field questions

## YOU DO—Temperature Converter (15 minutes)
- Check in at 10 minutes
- Ask a student to share their solution in Slack.
- **Pro Tip** You can format code with ``` or ``

## CLOSURE (5 minutes)
- Stay cool out there!
- Ask someone to explain `parseInt`
- Field any questions

## STAND UPS (10 minutes)

## Break. (10 minutes)
