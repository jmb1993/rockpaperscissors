###Part 1

Given the following arrays:

```javascript

var will = ["will", 50, "poop"]
var jason = ["jason", 17, "regal"]
var Adam = ["adam",9001,"sananab"]
var zhen = ["zhen", 186, "knits"]

```
- Jason can't remember his name. Remove his name from his array.
- Zhen just had his birthday, change the array to reflect him being a year older
- Adam has another favorite word, `"swag"`, add this to his array
- Will doesn't like poop anymore. Remove Wills favorite word from his array.

###Part 2

Given the following array of arrays:

```javascript
var pps = 
[
  ["adam", 350, "sananab"],
  ["jason", 17, "regal"],
  ["will",9001,"poop"],
  ["zhen", 186, "knits"]
];

```
Console log out
- The names of all the pps, with all capital letters, labeled as Name
- The numbers, labeled as Age
- The third word, reversed, labeled as Favorite word

The console should log like this.

```
Name: ADAM
Age: 350
Favorite word: bananas

```

###Part 3
For Your Consideration:

Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "0, 2, 4 is even and so on").
