Tonight you are going to write JavaScript statements to solve the following problems. This assignment is to get you to started thinking like a developer.

A starter HTML file has been provided and is where you should work tonight.

#### Subjects covered.

	Data Types, Variables, and Arrays
	Control Flow
	Loops

#### 1. The making of a varaible.
Create a varaible array that contains four strings.

- Get ready to ignite

hint: create an **something**, then use a **something** to iterate over it. 

#### 7. Let's take the Subway.
Write out the JavaScript that would do the following. :station:

- When the script is run a menu should be prompted displaying:
  - A list of three trains - `The (L) Train, The (N) Train, The (S)ix Train`
  - The prompt ask the user to make their selection
- When the user enters: `L`
  - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as L train
  - A console log output should contain the following:
    - `8th Ave`
    - `6th Ave`
    - `Union Square`
    - `3rd Ave`
    - `1st Ave`
    - `Bedford Ave`
- When the user enters: `N`
  - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as N train
  - A console log output should contain the following:
    - `Times Square`
    - `Herald Square`
    - `28th St`
    - `23rd St - DAPS Nexus`
    - `Union Square`
    - `8th St `
- When the user enters `S`
  - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as S train
  - A console log output should contain the following:
    - `Grand Central`
    - `33rd St`
    - `28th St`
    - `23rd St`
    - `Union Square`
    - `Astor Place`

- A Thank You message should be logged to the alert.
- The program should exit.

Bonus:
- Rather than exit after the program is run, let's allow the users to use our program until they choose to quit. 
  - This quit option should be accessible when users can choose a train line.
  - When the user quits, the program should alert the user than the program has ended.  

#### Finished? :trophy:
