There are people out there who are horrible hackers doing horrible things. ***That's not you!*** But that doesn't mean we can't have fun defacing websites for our own enjoyment.

In this lab, you pick a website, open the Chrome Developer Tools (cmd-ctrl-I, Elements tab), and change... everything! Some suggestions:
* Change background color or image! 
* Change fonts!
* Change font colors!
* Change logos!
* Change text!

#### Some suggestions for websites: ####
* Make google.com look like generalassemb.ly, or vice versa.
* Replace articles on nytimes.com with articles from theonion.com

### Happy spray-painting! ###
