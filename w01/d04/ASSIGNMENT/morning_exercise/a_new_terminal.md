# Episode 7: A New Terminal

A long time ago, in a Unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who
knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to
enterâ€¦ The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in
Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

    * "**princess-leia.txt**"
    * "**storm-trooper.txt**"
5. In "**galaxy-far-far-away**", make a directory named "**tatooine**" and create the following files in it:
    * "**luke.txt**"
    * "**ben-kenobi.txt**"
6. Inside of "**tatooine**" make a directory called "**millennium-falcon**", and in it create:
