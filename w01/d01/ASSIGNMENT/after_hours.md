# Markup Markdown, rehash Bash, and get the gist

##### Today we want you to get comfortable using Markdown syntax, solidify your understanding of Bash commands, and become acquainted with GitHub gists.
![Hello, Computer?](http://i1290.photobucket.com/albums/b536/NativeHadzaSpeaker/PxSFAnuubLkSA_zpszqjjtqfj.gif)


## Setup

Work in the `w01/d01/ASSIGNMENT` directory. Create a new directory called `after_hours` in which all of the following files will be created.

## Completion

Finish all the parts! Tonight's homework is a little different than usual, in that you need to do all five parts. In the future, homework will have a certain number of parts that you must finish for the homework to be considered complete, plus extra parts that we encourage you to do to get extra practice. The more practice you get, the betterâ€”but being healthy is best so get some sleep.

## Part 1
Read the [original Markdown docs](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and then read the [GitHub Flavored Markdown docs](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). Do some research about the history of Markdown, starting with Wikipedia. Also read the [Markdown cheatsheet we made for you](../../../resources/markdown_cheatsheet.md).

## Part 2
Read about Github gists [on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/).

## Part 3
Watch [this TED Talk about grit](http://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit?language=en). Create a markdown file called `grit.md` in your `homework` directory from the terminal, and write about your reflections on the video. Make sure to use Markdown syntax, and alter the text/font in ways that _aren't_ covered in the cheatsheet. To check what your Markdown formatting looks like, start a gist, change its language to Markdown, paste your text into the gist, and when you create the gist you will see your text rendered with Markdown. You can edit the gist and see how changing the Markdown syntax changes what the gist looks like.

## Part 4
Make another Markdown file called `bash_cheatsheet.md` in the `homework` directory and make yourself a cheatsheet about Bash commands. At a minimum, include the commands to:

  - create a directory
  - create a file
  - move a file
  - move a directory
  - rename a file
  - rename a directory
  - delete a file
  - delete a directory
  - move around within a directory
  - see what files and directories exist
  - check where in the directory structure you are.

Be as complete as possible and expand on this list; your cheatsheet will be a great resource for you from now on. This is another opportunity to practice Markdown, so include a table, a list (ordered or unordered), and a link.

## Part 5
Create a gist, give it a name, and change its language to Markdown. Put the following questions and your answers to the questions into the gist. Format it fully with Markdown. Create a Markdown file called `gist.md` in the `homework` directory with the link to your gist.
