![TotalRecall](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/08faf810399259.560e4428eab57.jpg)

### Write a chain-able function `recall` that accepts one argument a word(string) per function call but, when called without an arguments, will return back all the previously pased words in order.


When I run this...

```javascript
recall('Sorry,')('Your')('whole')('life')('is')('just')('a')('dream.')('I')('have')('been')('trying')('to')('tell')('you,')('someone')('has')('erased')('your')('memory.')();

//"Sorry, Your whole life is just a dream. I have been trying to tell you, someone has erased your memory. "
```
