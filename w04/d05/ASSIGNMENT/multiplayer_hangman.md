This weekend you're going to create a hangman game in the console, enhanced with Ruby classes and multiple players.


###Game play
* Play starts with choosing how many players will play (maximum of 6), and entering their names.
* Order of play should be random.
* The total number of words to be guessed will equal the number of players.
* Play proceeds in turns, regardless of whether the player guesses a letter correctly.
* A correct guess yields 1 point; an incorrect guess yields 0.
* Play proceeds until each word is guessed, then proceeds to the next word.
* The player with the most points after all the words have been played wins the game.

###User Stories
* As a user I would like to be able to see what letters each player has played.
* As a user I would like to be able to see the current status of the word, with hidden letters represented by underscores and guessed letters represented by their value.
* As a user I would like to be able to see the point totals for all players.

###Bonuses
* As a user I would like to see a text-based graphical representation of the players' status.
