Write a method that takes an argument (a number) and returns the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is the series of number whereby each new number is the sum of the previous two.
By convention, the first two numbers of the series are 0 and 1.

So if the input is (5)
There are the first 5 Fibonacci numbers:

0,1,1,2,3

Then...
return the sum of all even numbers in the sequence.
