There are 100 Goblins suffering from acid reflux, and there is sadistic witch doctor with the cure, the witch doctor could cure all of the Goblins if desired, but because of cruelity the witch chose to torture the Goblins with a little game. 

#### The witch will meet with these 100 Goblins 100 times.
Each time the Goblins will line up in a straight line 1 - 100, once the Goblins line up they cannot change thier position in line anymore (so the order of the Goblins in line doesn't change.)

#### For the first time when the witch meet with these 100 Goblins.
The witch start from the beginning of the line and give each of them the cure in turn, all 100 Goblins. 
(At this point all 100 Goblins has a cure in hand.)

#### For the second time the witch meet with these Goblins.
The witch start from the beginning of the line and again...but
This time the witch will starting with the second Goblin, and for every second Goblin.
The witch do the following, if that Goblin has a cure the witch will take it away. 
(At this point 50 Goblins still has the cure in hand, but the other 50 got the cure taken away)

#### For the third time the witch start from the beginning of the line and again...
Starting with the third Goblin, and for every third Goblin.
The witch do the following, if that Goblin has a cure the witch will take it away, but if the Goblin has no cure, the witch will give that Goblin a cure.
(At this point some number Goblins will have cure in hand, and some doesn't.)

#### The witch do it a fourth time, and go to every fourth Goblin as the third time. 
Then a fifth time. 
Then a sixth time.
Etc...
For a total of 100 times...

### At the end how many Goblins will have a cure in their hand.
And at which positions in line will those Goblins be standing.
