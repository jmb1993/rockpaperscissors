###JUMP TO SYMBOL

One of the most important and time saving shortcuts when working inside of a file is the ability to quickly browse through symbols in your current file. **CMD + R** opens a search bar which will allow you to filter through symbols inside of your file.

###JUMP TO FILES

Similarly to searching for symbols in your current file it is common to switch between files in your directory. This can become time consuming when done manually. **CMD + P** opens a search bar which will allow you to fildter through other files inside or your program.

###MARK CURRENT WORD

When you are trying to select a specific word you could always double click it, but why use your mouse if you don't have to?? **CMD + D** will select the word that your cursor is current positioned on, subsequent **CMD + D** presses will select the next instance of that word in your file.

###MOVE A BLOCK OF TEXT

Lets say you need to move a line or block of text up or down a few lines. You could copy, paste, then delete the text, or even cut it and paste it, but there is an easier way. **CMD + CTRL + UP / DOWN ARROW** will allow you to move the highlighted text without having to do any of those other things.

###SPLIT SCREEN

This feature will be particularlly useful if you are working on a file that has to interact with another file. **CMD + OPT(alt) + 2** will split your screen into two vertically, allowing you to place a seperate file in each window pane. You can further split the screen by replacing **2** with **3-5** and return to single view with **1**

###GO TO LINE

There will be many times when your program will exceed 100 lines. Lets say you have an error on line 458, would it be easier to scroll to that line or jump to it. Luckily there is a shortcut for this. **CMD + G** will bring up a dialog, just insert the line number you want to go to into the dialog and off you go.

###DISTRACTION FREE MODE

Often you will have other applications open that send notifications flying across your screen. Although this is nice and may make you feel loved it can be a disctraction and interupt your work flow. **CMD + CTRL + SHIFT + F** will send you into distraction free mode allowing you to avoid those pesky notifications when you want to be in the zone.
